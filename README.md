COnsole: command interpreter to manage the Airbnb clone website.
## AirBnB clone project

Building a home rental website mimicking the workigs of the AirBnB website from
back-end to front-end.

### The Console

The web application needs to handle objects, such as users, cities, etc. The
console is a command interpreter to generate these and handle them using
commands.

#### How it works (in progress)
| command | usage | function |
| :====== | :==== | :======= |
| help | help \<command\> | list commands, or description of command if given |
| quit/Ctrl+D | quit/Ctrl+D | exits the program |
| create | create \<class\_name\> | create an instance of the class |
